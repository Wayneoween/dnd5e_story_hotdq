# Mirtul 4

On our way to the "Singing sword" to meet {% include glossary_link.html title="Tysra" %} for drinks, the group discovered
a statue of a dwarf holding a beer mug, called "The great drunkard". Apparently,
this and other statues are protectors of Waterdeep. {% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %} was simply smitten.

As we met {% include glossary_link.html title="Tysra" %} in the pub, she told us that there would be a change of plans:
One of the personal guards of Lord Neverember (Lord of {% include glossary_link.html title="Waterdeep" %}) was discovered
to be a cultist. There was not enough proof to accuse him publicly, but we had
to make sure he would not be able to attend the council meeting the next day.
Luckily there was a chance: The guard was part of a fight club, so all we had to
do is knock him out in the ring and the {% include glossary_link.html title="Order of the Gauntlet" %} would take care of
the rest.

Shan would enter the unarmed contest, {% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %} armed. {% include glossary_link.html title="Kaiya" %} would be watching
from the sidelines. {% include glossary_link.html title="Fynn" %} kept busy by bedding one of the barmaids at the Singing
Sword.

As we arrived at the old amphitheater, {% include glossary_link.html title="Kaiya" %} changed into a black dragonborn,
not unlike what Rezmir looked like. The first round, as fate would have it, saw
{% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %} pitched against {% include glossary_link.html title="Tysra" %}. She proved to be the far superior fighter though
and thoroughly kicked his ass. {% include glossary_link.html title="Kaiya" %} was quite happy with the result, as she had
placed a bet of 10 GPs on {% include glossary_link.html title="Tysra" %}, turning to 30 GPs as a result. On a positive
note, {% include glossary_link.html title="Tysra" %} had a chance to tell the group what the guard actually looked like,
since we had forgotten to ask that tiny detail previously.

The second fight now was {% include glossary_link.html title="Shan" %} against the guard, a Tabaxi monk. As they bowed to
each other, {% include glossary_link.html title="Shan" %} saw a small purple claw clasp on him. In a hard fight, {% include glossary_link.html title="Shan" %}
managed to K.O. the opponent. {% include glossary_link.html title="Kaiya" %} had once again proven her betting instinct,
turning another 10 GPs to 50 GPs.

The tabaxi was brought to a back room, where we had a chance to interrogate him.
{% include glossary_link.html title="Kaiya" %} did this, seeing as she looked like Rezmir. The tabaxi was in a bad mood,
but willingly shared information. He said he would be going to the Well soon,
because "it" shouldn't take much longer. Questioned about other undercover
cultists, he says there were more in Baldur's Gate and {% include glossary_link.html title="Neverwinter" %}. As {% include glossary_link.html title="Kaiya" %} put
him to sleep, we discussed that this meant that cultists probably had
infiltrated all sorts of institutions, including the council we would meet
tomorrow.

Back to the Singing Sword, {% include glossary_link.html title="Tysra" %} soon excused herself, while we discussed how to
proceed. Kaiya would activate her old network here in {% include glossary_link.html title="Waterdeep" %} to find out more
about cultists infiltrating city officials. One information we gained was that
Varram, the dwarf that took the white dragon mask from {% include glossary_link.html title="Talis the White" %}, got the
mask stolen in turn. The thief was of the "{% include glossary_link.html title="Zhentarim" %}" crime network. Maybe this
give us a chance to acquire another one of the dragon masks. 

After a good night's sleep, the next morning we finally arrived at the council
meeting...
