# Flamerule 4th, sunrise

The frost giants kindly let us use their teleportation conch to move from up

a fight ensued. Luckily, our battle-hardened group disposed of the cultists and
drakes with little issue.

Next, we found a cell with Blagothkus' daughter, and freed her. Eventually, we
reached the end of the tunnels and found ourselves at the foot of the unholy
cathedral in the middle of the volcano, rising from the ground through a mighty
ritual. Floating above, three red wizards. And on the middle spire, there was
