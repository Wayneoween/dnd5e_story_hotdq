### 3rd of Ches - Longsaddle

We arrived in Longsaddle which was on fire and was attacked by cultists before we arrived. After helping, we met *Fei Long* in the Triboar Tavern called *Fuzzy Quarterstaff*.
We tried to find the Cultist camp in the night but it was too dark.

### 4th of Ches - Searching for the Cultist camp

We found and fought some cultists and met *Gronkh* the Kobold. I gave him one of Venomfangs teeth.

### 6th of Ches - Cultist camp

We did some things, fought some bad guys and killed the *Black Spider*.

Destroyed two dragon eggs. It felt very bad. We, or at least *Shan* and I, didn’t want to kill the Guard Drakes, but there was no other way.
The greater good is to stop the revival of the five headed chromatic dragon *Tiamat*. And apparently we need to stop that from happening.
After deciding not to take another closer look after that Roper, we made our way to Longsaddle.

### 8th of Ches - Longsaddle

Meeting Shans friends *Shang Liang* and *Fei Long* who seem to have recovered.
*Shang Liang* was captured in the camp and freed by us a few days ago. Wants to go to Triboar to meet *Ontharr Frume*. A prominent figure in Triboar. Seems to be a tavern owner of the “Pair of black antlers”.
And head of the Order of the Gauntlet there.
*Fei Long* will return to Master *Shi-Fu* to report what we found.
