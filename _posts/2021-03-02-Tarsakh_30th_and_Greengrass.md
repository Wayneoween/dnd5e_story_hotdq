# Tarsakh 30

At breakfast, we already saw a cultist wearing the crescent moon symbol.
Sunysyl came through on his promise! However, we were still lacking a good
plan on how to proceed.

We decided to take one more day to stake out the cultists: How many are there
of the cultists faction? And are the ones who are not, really irredeemable?

The group split up to pursue various duties. {% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %} talked to one cultists
during a break, asking if he felt bad sometimes about all the robbing,
murdering and pillaging. Nope, the cultists showed no remorse. {% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %} has
made up his mind: The cultists need to die.

Same for {% include glossary_link.html title="Fynn" %}: He had the chance to talk to two cultists, one with a crescent
moon symbol and one without. The one with the symbol seemed quiet and
thoughtful. The other one though, seemed *really* into it. He told the story
about the library of waterdeep, how he discovered a book on dragons there,
how he met a cultist recruiter, how they talked all night. "I will be there
when Severin puts the masks together and raises {% include glossary_link.html title="Tiamat" %}!".

{% include glossary_link.html title="Shan" %} had the duty to feed the dragon and decided to just... talk to it.
Bored, evil, ancient and old, the dragon was not much interested in
exchanging much information though.

{% include glossary_link.html title="Kaiya" %} was looking for Abras Jos and the other wizard in the meantime.

The result of our scouting: There are 21 cultists on the castle, 7 of whom
are on our side. The other ones were starting to wonder what happened to the
4 or 5 that we had killed --- were we their replacement? Furthermore there
are two hill giants on our side. Plus Blagothkus staff. This is a fight we
should be able to win!

We did one more check with Sunysyl, whether he would backstab us. She still
kinda likes having a flying castle, but she would stay out of our affair if
we waited for sunrise, thus giving her an alibi.

We rest one more time.

# Greengrass

A new day! {% include glossary_link.html title="Fynn" %} gave a special "holiday" performance, thus getting all 21
cultists in a room. We managed somehow to sort out the seven that have the
symbol, after which Blagothkus sealed the room. With that settled for now,
{% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %} proposed to Blagothkus to take care of the dragon below the castle
together...
