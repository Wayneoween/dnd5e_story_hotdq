### 3rd of Ches - {% include glossary_link.html title="Longsaddle" %}

We arrived in {% include glossary_link.html title="Longsaddle" %} which was on fire and was attacked by cultists before
we arrived. After helping, we met *Fei Long* in the {% include glossary_link.html title="Triboar" %} Tavern called
*Fuzzy Quarterstaff*. We tried to find the Cultist camp in the night but it was
too dark.

### 4th of Ches - Searching for the Cultist camp

We found and fought some cultists and met *Gronkh* the Kobold. I gave him one
of {% include glossary_link.html title="Venomfangs" name="Venomfang" %} teeth.
