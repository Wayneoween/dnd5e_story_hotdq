Spring is here! We did some light travel and noticed that there seems to be
more of that dragon business going on here in the north...

### 3rd of Ches - Longsaddle

We arrived in Longsaddle which was on fire and was attacked by cultists before
we arrived. After helping, we met *Fei Long* in the Triboar Tavern called
*Fuzzy Quarterstaff*. We tried to find the Cultist camp in the night but it was
too dark.

### 4th of Ches - Searching for the Cultist camp

We found and fought some cultists and met *Gronkh* the Kobold. I gave him one
of Venomfangs teeth.
