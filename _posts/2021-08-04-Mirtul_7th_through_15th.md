# Mirtul 7

After our battle with the Marrows, {% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %} was asked by the captain to say a
prayer to Torm as a funeral rite for the two fallen seamen. They were wrapped in
cloth and tossed overboard, into their icy graves.  On the third day, {% include glossary_link.html title="Kaiya" %} saw
a gigantic white dragon on the horizon. Luckily he didn't appear to see us.
Lenka told us to play dead if he ever saw us, since this dragon "The old white
death" had no interest in toying with dead people.  The Old White Death
apparently has a habit of collecting "interesting" people, such as wizards and
fighters. He and his partner, a female dragon often seen around Icewind Dale,
learn their skills and talents until they have spent their usefulness.  The crew
seemed afraid to get closer to the dragon. They still did not know that this is
exactly where we were heading.

Lenka also told us that Oyaviggaton is a village of a northern ice hunter tribe.
She did not have more details but we must assume that they have an alliance with
the dragon, since they are living in such close proximity to each other. So we
should be on guard when we inevitably meet them.  {% include glossary_link.html title="Kaiya" %} asked Lenka about the
dragon cultists, whether they have come this far north. Lenka has heard of them,
but not details. The only thing she mentioned is that they encountered a
darker-skinned person with a "pet-dragon" heading north. We wonder who this
might be. Lenka also knew a little about the Draakhorn, but only what is
publicly known. She seemed to have no idea that it was right here, under our
noses.

{% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %} keeps smoking his pipe that he bought in Luskan. After the awkward
incident with Dasarve he wanted to figure this thing out better. The pipe keeps
showing heroic battle scenes and with the narration from him and {% include glossary_link.html title="Fynn" %}, this
little show helped us get a little closer to the crew.

After seven or eight days, we were getting close to Oyaviggaton. The last bit of
distance was covered by rowboat, while the ship and crew stayed behind at a safe
distance. Only Lenka came with us. The captain once more implored us that we
take care of his sister. Him and Lenka each had a ring, which they could use to
communicate, so we could call the ship back after we were done, or if anything
happened.  Before us was a huge iceberg, accessible by a boardwalk that led onto
a plateau. This area was littered with huge cracked bones. Lenka told us these
were whale bones, gnawed by dragon teeth. Maybe this shined a light on the
relationship between Oyaviggaton's residents and the dragon. Maybe they bring
him food in exchange for protection - or simply to stay alive.

We climbed some steps, carved directly into the ice, to reach a second, higher
plateau. Here, we ran into a bunch of sled dogs that immediately started to
bark. We now were swarmed by around 25 armed people, with more - and children -
emerging from nearby huts.  We had to think on our feet: We had already decided
that we were only here to save WanRenMi and retrieve the Draakhorn. If we could
avoid the dragon, that would probably be wise. But what is it we would tell
those people...?

Open:

- Rescue WanRenMi
- Get Draakhorn
- Find Zhentarim to acquire the white dragon mask. Go to “Earls Tavern” in {% include glossary_link.html title="Waterdeep" %} to find them.
- Talk to Remalia Haventree when we’re back in {% include glossary_link.html title="Waterdeep" %}
- Blackstaff, Archmage of {% include glossary_link.html title="Waterdeep" %}, kept {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %}’s orb to find out more about it in Candlekeep. If she discovers useful information, we owe her a favor.
