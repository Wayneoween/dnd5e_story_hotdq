# Mirtul 5

In the evening of the day of the council meeting, the group discussed what
needed to be done before setting out to the Sea of Moving Ice. We decided to go
to the Blackstaff Tower and try to learn more about {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %}'s mysterious sphere.
Maybe someone could tell us more about where he went?

Blackstaff tower is an imposing building, a huge black tower with glass
contraptions floating around it. And, as we discovered: No doors.  {% include glossary_link.html title="Fynn" %} tried to
plead to be let in, to no avail. As we almost wanted to leave, we saw a young
wizard deep in thoughts go to the tower and touch a certain stone, upon which he
could enter the tower. We did the same and immediately found ourselves at the
inside, looking upon an enormous hall with staircases leading to portals,
wizards moving about... a disorientingly busy panorama!

Since we didn't know where to go, we did as told by the young wizard and took a
seat in the hall, waiting for Blackstaff to show up. We observed our environment
and saw that the portals led to all sorts of destinations: Some to huge
libraries, some to world of fire, water... we briefly discussed taking off to
explore a bit, but decided to stick to our mission.

After 1.5 hours, Blackstaff arrived and could be convinced to spare some of her
time. She led us to her study room, where she examined the orb with her magic
abilities. She said it gave off "curious energy", reminding her of "the old
ones", ancient beings roaming the Astral Sea who usually don't bother with the
affairs of mortals. She tried to Scry on {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %} as owner of the orb, but did so
without success - he was not on this plane anymore. Out of other options, she
offered to keep the orb and go research in Candlekeep, the largest library in
Toril. She would trade any useful information with us in exchange for an
unspecified favor, which got {% include glossary_link.html title="Fynn" %} very suspicious. We decided to keep it with
her anyways, since this is our best shot at finding out more about {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %}'s
whereabouts.

As for the white dragon mask, she told us that we would probably be able to find
{% include glossary_link.html title="Zhentarim" %} in a Pub close to "Earls Tavern". Rean Nightshade will probably be
there too.

# Mirtul 6th

The next morning, after an early brakfast, we went back to the tower and were
equipped with all the necessary gear and rations for the icy north. We would be
transported to the Tower of the Arcane Brotherhood in Luskan. Master Shifu gave
{% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %} 30 GPs as payment for our guide there, Lenka Iceskimmer. He stressed
that we should return the Draakhorn but also try to find and rescue WanRenMi.
Shanliang gave {% include glossary_link.html title="Shan" %} a heartfelt goodbye hug - and off we were, through the
portal. On the other side, a red Tiefling, called Maccath the Crimson welcomed
us to Luskan.

Open:

- Give 30 GPs to Lenka Iceskimmer as payment to be our guide
- Rescue WanRenMi
- Get Draakhorn
- Find Zhentarim to acquire the white dragon mask. Go to "Earls Tavern" in {% include glossary_link.html title="Waterdeep" %} to find them.
- Talk to Remalia Haventree when weâ€™re back in {% include glossary_link.html title="Waterdeep" %}
- Blackstaff, Archmage of {% include glossary_link.html title="Waterdeep" %}, kept {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %}'s orb to find out more about it in Candlekeep. If she discovers useful information, we owe her a favor.
