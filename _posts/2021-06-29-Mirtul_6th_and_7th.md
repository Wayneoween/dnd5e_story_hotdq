# Mirtul 6

After a brief exchange with Maccath the Crimson, who was mostly interested to
see us out of the "Host Tower", we started to explore Luskan. One Information we
did get from the Tiefling though was that the location where the dragon lives
within the Sea of Moving Ice was called Oyaviggaton.

Luscan was a real pirate town, full of thieves. The so-called "ships" there are
local crime families. The city itself is heavily fortified, with a large harbor
and impressive watchtowers. The city itself is a little run-down, as one would
expect from a place where law and order has no grasp.

And no wonder: {% include glossary_link.html title="Fynn" %} has an Uncle here! He is called "Gral Blackbarrel", a
half-elf with black pockmarked skin. We are beginning to see a pattern in the
naming of {% include glossary_link.html title="Fynn" %}'s family. They always have some "-barrel" in their last names.
And a lot of them have Taverns, many of which have a familiar sign: Two barrels
with someone sitting on it.

This tavern now had a very mixed audience. What stood out to us is that a lot of
people had tattoos, almost as if they were marked to belong to a specific ship.
{% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %} at first was quite suspicious of the place but quickly appeased by the
fact that they served pretty decent ale.

{% include glossary_link.html title="Fynn" %} immediately sought out Gral. At first they tried without success to
establish their relationship to each other, but finally seemed to agree that
they must be in some way related. Gral told {% include glossary_link.html title="Fynn" %} that we would find Lenka
Frostskimmer at Captain Lerustah's ship "The Dragon Beach". The one calling the
shots in this town seemed to be a captain called the "Queen of Pirates", the
"First High Captain Beniago Kurth".

We went to the dragon beach where we quickly found the ship in question, called
"The Yeti". It was a rather small, lighter ship with - again - a very mixed
crew. {% include glossary_link.html title="Kaiya" %} took the lead on this one. First without success, until {% include glossary_link.html title="Shan" %} simply
shouted out Lenka's name until she emerged from the ship. A discussion ensued on
the logistics and price of going to our destination. Finally, we agreed on 60
GPs for the trip, which we thought was a very fair price.

Before we left, we decided to run some errands in the city. First, we bought
loads of rations, Shan and Kaiya each stored 100 of them. Additionally, {% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %}
gave the crew 20 GPs to buy food and something to warm them from the inside.
Then, we stopped at "Bernald's Emporium", which sells bounty. {% include glossary_link.html title="Shan" %} bought a wool
cap and scarf ("Hat of vermin"), Fynn decided to do the same . {% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %} bought a
pipe and tobacco (A "Pipe of Rememberance"). We did not know that they bought
special items yet, however.

The next morning we met at the boat, ready to leave. Lenka's brother was at the
steering wheel, apparently the captain. We had arranged to help the crew and
learn along the way:

- {% include glossary_link.html title="Fynn" %} -> Navigator -> Paired with Sidus (Goliath)
- {% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %} -> Gunman -> Dasarve (Dragonborn of unknown gender, with silver scales)
- {% include glossary_link.html title="Shan" %} -> Cook -> Onek (Dwarf with dark skin and hair, a quiet person)
- {% include glossary_link.html title="Kaiya" %} -> Deckhand -> Gelvi (a lively Gnome)

We set sails towards the sea of moving ice, unknowing what would await us there...
