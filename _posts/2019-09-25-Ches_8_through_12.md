### 8th of Ches - Longsaddle

Meeting Shans friends *Shang Liang* and *Fei Long* who seem to have recovered.
*Shang Liang* was captured in the camp and freed by us a few days ago. Wants to go to Triboar to meet *Ontharr Frume*. A prominent figure in Triboar. Seems to be a tavern owner of the “Pair of black antlers”.
And head of the Order of the Gauntlet there.
*Fei Long* will return to Master *Shi-Fu* to report what we found.

We procured an immensely overpriced cart for our belongings but were able to pay only a tiny portion of what was asked. Also an oxen.

### 9th through 12th of Ches

We travel with *Shang Liang* from Longsaddle to Triboar where we are to meet with said *Ontharr Frume* who happens to be related to Fynn and is the owner of the *Pair of black antlers* inn.

The existence of more or less secret factions is revealed to us:

- "The Order of the gauntlet" devoted to upholding order and peace, and striking hard and fast against evil - but never preemtively. Ontharr is a member.

- "The Harpers" devoted to gathering information and using it for good. Less tight-knit that the Gauntlet-faction but present everywhere. ShanLiang is a member.

- "The Emerald Enclave" some natureloving people.

- "The Lord's Alliance" for noble people or so.

- "Zenharim" (?) for... less lawful individuals.

Currently the Harpers and the Gauntlet are working together against the cultist problem.
Thoredim eagerly became a member of the Gauntlet, but we think he'll have to work on the "no first strike" rule.

Regardless of us joining any of the factions, we are tasked to investigate the cultists that are said to hide in caravans heading south and reporting if and what we find.

Thoredim's beloved Electrum Ale Mug was pickpocketed by Kayia while he as armwrestling Ontharr, and he was severly bullied.
