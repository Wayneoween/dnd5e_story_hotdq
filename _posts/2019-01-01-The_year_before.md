We met each other in a small town called Phandalin, on the northern part of the
Sword Coast. The village was haunted by a local gang of bandits called
"Redbrands", recognizable by their scarlet cloaks. We had a few run-ins with
them and eventually freed the town of their presence, which led us to some
clues for further adventures.

A note on Townmaster Harbin Wester's bulletin board led us on a mission to
eradicate a camp of Orcs at Wyvern Tor to the east of the town. Also, Sister
Garaele gave us a comb to bring to a Banshee called Agatha that resided
nearby in exchange for her to answer one question for us: The location of the
Spellbook of Wizard "Bowgentle". She told us, but this information was no use
to us. After paying her a visit, we cleaned out the Orc Encampment and
returned to Phandalin to collected our reward of 100 Gold. On each visit to
Phandalin, Finn intimately and repeatedly bonded with the local Barmaid.

In Phandalin we also met Sildar Hallwinter, who told us about the dwarf Gundren
Rockseeker who, with his two brothers Tharden and Nundro planned to re-open the
legendary {% include glossary_link.html title="Wave Echo Cave" %} and reestablish the area, and Phandalin with it, as a
place of fortune. Sildar belongs to the {% include glossary_link.html title="Lord's Alliance" %}. His guild-brother
Iarno Albrek, turned evil and was the one who founded the
Redbrands, under the Mentorship of the {% include glossary_link.html title="Black Spider" %}, a major evil presence in
the area. The Black spider was also the one that captured Gundren Rockseeker
since he was looking for the Forge of Spells inside the {% include glossary_link.html title="Wave Echo Cave" %}, which
is still active, as we learned from a diary we found raiding the Redbrands' lair.

On the way to our next adventure, we stumbled over an old structure in which a
Necromancer by the name of Hamun Kost (Human Crust) has taken camp and started
raising an army of Undead. Our group could not come up with a compelling reason
to either attack or ally with him which led to an in-depth discussion on the
morals of bringing people back from the dead. Eventually though, we left him
alone and freed a nearby castle, called Cragmar Castle of King Grohl and his
army of Goblins.

From Reidoth, a local druid who knows the area well, we hear stories of dragon
activiy increasing lately.

A little later, we arrived in Thundertree, the ruins of the village where
{% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %} grew up, and that was one day destroyed by a green dragon. Here was
the first time we heard of a cult of dragon worshipping, wanting to raise a
legendary dragon called {% include glossary_link.html title="Tiamat" %}, which is trapped in the nine hells and with it,
an army of undead dragons. We encountered a group of low-ranking and frankly,
inept dragon cultists.

The group also found {% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %}'s former home and with it, a diary from an
unknown author writing about {% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %} Longaxe, {% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %}'s father. It retells
the story of the author trying to help the villagers defend their village from
the dragon's attacks, supplying them with potions and salves against their
burns. One day, a group of fighters ventures out to slain the dragon, only
{% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %}'s father returns, badly wounded. The author goes looking for plants to
heal him, but upon his return, he found the village completely devastated by
the dragon. No information on the father's survival. However, we gather the
information that {% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %}'s mother is probably still alive, in a village many
days of travel south called Greenest! Suddenly, the dragon returned and was
defeated by us in a fierce battle. After the first time fighting a dragon, we
took a bunch of dragon teeth as souvenir, which should turn out quite handy
later on several occasions. Later we would learn that the dragon's name was
"{% include glossary_link.html title="Venomfang" %}"

After all this adventuring, we decided it is finally time to pick a name for
our group. "The Five," "Five guys" was eventually dismissed in favor of "The F*
Five", a malleable name that can be adjusted to any occasion.

Finally, we make it to the fabled {% include glossary_link.html title="Wave Echo Cave" %}. Close to the Entrance, we
found the corpse of Tharden, one of the three Rockseeker brothers. Fighting our
way through poisonous funghi, skeletons, Buckbears and Shapeshifters, we
encountered the {% include glossary_link.html title="Black Spider" %}, a dragonborn. We learned that he wanted to build
a horde for the dragon queen, and that this horde is going to Greenest - where
{% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %}'s mother presumably currently resides! Unfortunatley, he escaped the
battle to live another day, an we should not catch up with him until a couple
weeks later in the dragon cultist's camp close to {% include glossary_link.html title="Longsaddle" %}. {% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %} found a
weapon made in the Forge of Spells, Lightbringer, which he will wield from now
on. The Cave, and with it the forge, are now back in the hands of the remaining
two Rockseeker brothers. Shall we ever return to the area, a sizeable cut of
their profits will be waiting for us!
