### 15th of Ches - Still on the {% include glossary_link.html title="Long Road" %}

We were heading on with the caravan, when we noticed a head on the road - well
more like a man buried up to his head. He had a sign saying *Oathbreaker* on
him. Fynn woke him up and asked about his story, which the man recounted as
having tried to snug out before his wedding and the father of the bride doing
this. The group was not sure whether to help him which possibly meant risk losing the
caravan, so time was of the essence! Shan used his earthquake spell, but the
poor man was still stuck, just a bit more shaken. Thoredim decided to dig,
while Kaiya started putting flowers around him. When one arm was freed, Posmet
gave him a stick and one Ration, so he could do the rest, in exchangewe learned
his name *Carlon Amufel*. Fynn, Shan and Kaiya dug him out after all, and he
confessed that he actually followed the last caravan because of some
"suspicious people" in it. He is one of the harpers, tasked to follow them.
Unfortunately, they caught him in Westbridge and buried him - a harpers symbol
tattooed on his arm confirms this story.

In the eveing, Kaiya talked to Carlon a bit more and found out that there is
one dragon mask for each type of chromatic dragon. Carlon followed the supposed
cultists since *Flint Rock*, which was a town the cultists raided. He now plans
to meet up with his fellows in waterdeep. Kaiya briefly inquired deeper into
the {% include glossary_link.html title="Harpers" %}, then quickly lost interest when hearing about their principle
about "being fair to everyone".

### 16th of Ches

At breakfast, Jemna grabbed Thoredims bowl and produces a curled up piece of
bone from its contents, which was probably planted by the cultists, she
explains. Still unsure about her motifs, the group wonders if Jemna herself may
have planted it there? To get peace of mind, Thoredim asked Jemna to agree to
step into a "Zone of Truth" cast by him and answer some questions. After some
questioning, the group was convinced her motifs are true, she really is driven
by stopping the cultists. She is part of a cult but refused mentioning its
name.

In the evening, Jemna warns the group of the *Red Wizard*, a powerful cult in
{% include glossary_link.html title="Thay" %}.

### 19th of Ches

About one hour before Red Larch the group was woken up by screams and
murmuring: one of the cultists has been murdered! The murder weapon was a short
sword, and first suspicions quickly arose. Jos stepped forward to calm people
down, to remarkable success. Jemna kept the suspicion on Jos, but actually was
quite suspicious herself. The Harper relayed an information to the group, that
the cultists plan their meetup at a place called the *Carnath Road House*.

### 23th of Ches

On a difficult stretch of road, the cart of the cultists tipped over and among
the broken boxes with dried meat, some jewellery spilled out. The group helped
them fix the cart while acting unsuspecting

### 26th of Ches - Finally, {% include glossary_link.html title="Waterdeep" %}!

We have reached {% include glossary_link.html title="Waterdeep" %}! The group hands the cart to a hireling, it will be
parked at the north gate until the next night. The oxen has been baptized Olaf.
Next, the group headed to *Charlo's Wonderous Vault* to get night goggles,
planning to catch up with the cultists and follow them to their destination
afterwards.
