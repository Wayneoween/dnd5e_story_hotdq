# Mirtul 27 (continued)

We spent the evening before our departure from {% include glossary_link.html title="Waterdeep" %} in the usual tavern.
{% include glossary_link.html title="Shan" %} was deep in thought, struggling with the fact that we are regularly killing
people along our missions. He concluded that he would try to knock them
unconscious and otherwise... just look away. A messenger appeared, telling us to
meet Elias outside the city the next morning. {% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %} tried to make him drink
with the group, before learning that the boy was a mere twelve years of age.
Kaija once more recounted the story of her former lover and his "unfortunate"
end. The group grew more curious about this village that {% include glossary_link.html title="Kaiya" %} used to call her
home.

Eventually, {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %} would tell the group some hobgoblin children stories. Also,
we learned some more about his exile. He has no more allies in his former
company. His mother dead, his brothers his worst enemy, he has no way back there
and apparently no desire to do so anyways. Before we went to bed, we arranged
another four weeks of parking for Olaf. Here's to hoping we won't forget him
this time.

The next four days were spent flying on Elia's back to the Serpent hills, what
an adventure! Before saying our goodbyes, Elias told us to call him via sending
when we are ready to move on. Alternatively, he described a place for us to meet
him in ten days.

Before us was a rolling hillscape, rocky and somewhat barren. {% include glossary_link.html title="Kaiya" %} saw smoke in
the distance and after 30 minutes of walking, we found a group of humans sitting
around a campfire. They were on the run from "Naraja", a place south of where we
were. {% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %} got his hopes up briefly, when he heard that one of them was from
Greenest, the possible current location of his mother, but alas, he had no
useful information.  However, the people could point us in the direction where
they saw some Yuan-Ti, so this is where we went next. {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %} shot down one of
the vultures circling above us, as to scare them away so they wouldn't give away
our position.

Eventually, we went into a canyon in which we found ancient ruins of
settlements. After following the canyon for a while, we encountered a dead end
with two 20ft statues standing there. Upon examination, the statues started
moving and told the group they offer wisdom or knowledge. {% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %} said
"Knowledge". The statues told us we would find what we were looking for - IF we
heed the wizard.

We entered the cave. Passed the first room by not looking at the six statues in
them. Fought a 2D Chimera in the next room. The next room was weird: Had written
"Safe" on the door, in it a wall at the bottom, a basin, a lever, camping gear,
mushrooms that looked like bloody liver. We tried getting some water from the
well and putting it into the basin - a drain would open and the water would
flush out. No further effect. We left the room without a result, but with the
feeling that we left something important undiscovered there...

We went to the next door, on it was a depiction of a basin and wizards (?). The
door was bulging as if a great weight was on it. {% include glossary_link.html title="Kaiya" %} used mage hand to open
it. Behind it was a huge heap of rubble, probably too much to remove manually
(IN GAME: The passage to rooms 4-12). We chose to follow a narrow passageway
instead. Behind us, a ball of bones appeared, slowly rolling towards us. We made
it out the other end (while {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %} stopped the ball). In the next room there was
a riddle, telling us to pay tribute to Mystril. Since none of us could make
sense of this, we decided to simply ignore it and open the next door. Six
mummies appeared around us.
