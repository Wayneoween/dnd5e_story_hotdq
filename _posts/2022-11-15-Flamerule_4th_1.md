# Flamerule 4, the Well of Dragons

### Intro

> You run out through the tunnel into the open expanse of the volcano pit. First
> you are blinded by the sun shining through clouds above, so bright in contrast
> to the flickering torch light in the underground tunnels. Your ears are overrun
> by a wave of battle sounds. You hear the roaring of dragons, the metallic
> clanging of sword against sword, mages shouting spells and their effects
> impacting the brimstone. You can hear the screams of people being hit by swords
> and spells.
>
> The air is filled with the smell of burning flesh, acid eating through stone and
> blood seeping into the ground. Below you, you can feel the ground rumbling and
> shaking and as objects impact close to you and as a gargantuan mass pushes up
> from somewhere beneath.
>
> Slowly your eyes adjust to the brightness and you see the Temple of {% include glossary_link.html title="Tiamat" %}
> rising from the earth. The Temple is made up of 6 jagged spires, five of them
> surrounding a larger middle one. Each of them consists of two storeys of
> archways, illuminated in the faint light of a chromatic dragon's colour. The
> construction of the spires does not seem to follow any reason or plan and sharp
> edges protrude from the obsidian stone they are made of.
>
> Through the archways you can see, floating on each level in every spire, a
> wizard in red robes deep in concentration muttering incantations. On the top
> most spire you see a man, wearing purple robes, a tiny red dragon sitting on his
> shoulder, arms outstretched, his gaze fixed on a point below him. His head is
> crowned with a mask of five dragon heads.

Our group, the F Five immediately threw ourselves into battle with all we had.
Possibly for the last time in our lives. There were five wizards on the ground
level, five on the spires and Severin on the middle spire, 100 feet above the
ground. We attacked the lower wizards first who were busy raising the spires.

{% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %} drew first blood, chopping a wizard's head right off. {% include glossary_link.html title="Tiamat" %}'s green head
appeared meanwhile, immediately spewing acid towards a group of Frost Giants who
were approaching, to devastating effect.

Kajya killed a second wizard with a bolt between the eyes. {% include glossary_link.html title="Shan" %}, in what looked
like an impossible move, ran up one of the spires striking down the wizard
there. Suddenly, a cone of cold hit him - {% include glossary_link.html title="Tiamat" %}'s white head had appeared!

Stuck on the lower level, {% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %} and Kajya mount our metallic dragon ally
Elias who swooped in and brought them close to one of the wizards on top. Elias
quickly kills this one, neatly biting his top half off. Revenge came right away
from {% include glossary_link.html title="Tiamat" %} with a poison attack that almost killed Kajya and caused her to jump
off the dragon's back to seek cover.

Severin luckily so far was still focussed on raising {% include glossary_link.html title="Tiamat" %}, giving our group an
opening. {% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %} and Elias dashed to his position at the top of the cathedral
and attacked him, however he quickly teleported away to a middle spire. {% include glossary_link.html title="Shan" %}
immediately seized the chance and closed in with Severin, heroically jumping
through a wall of fire and just... dealing with the damage, somewhat helped by
his now magnificent Ki aura.

{% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %} remained stuck on the lowest level and we could really need his power up
there, so Elias swooped down to pick him up. Halfway down, {% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %} jumped off
to face Severin a second time, unfortunately faceplanting, but unfazed to join
{% include glossary_link.html title="Shan" %} in the fight. Suddenly - a bolt out of nowhere! Kajya, from a great
distance, had shot Severin in the head and sent him tumbling to the ground. She
took note of where he landed to check out his body later, as she couldn't help
but hear a slight hint of familiarity in his voice when he was shouting his
incantations before...

Now, there was only one foe left to face: {% include glossary_link.html title="Tiamat" %}, now almost completely risen
and out for blood.
