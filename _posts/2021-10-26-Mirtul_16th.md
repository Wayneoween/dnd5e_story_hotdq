# Mirtul 16th

No time to talk to Posmet! With an enormous rumble, the whole ship we were
standing on crashed 60 feet into the depth. We could only save ourselves thanks
to our dragon cultist cloaks. As we regained our bearings, we found ourselves
now inside a gigantic ice cave - with the Dragon right there, looking at us.

Immediately, we had to prepare for a fight. The first attack of the dragon with
his ice breath made it clear that he was a formidable enemy, possibly way
stronger than us. At first, we did no damage at all to the dragon, but after a
while we gained our footing and a fierce battle took place. Suddenly Lenka came
out of nowhere to help, a welcome sight! Thoredim went down, to be rescued by
Shan and Posmet's Dragon Blade got its first taste of blood.

Finally, and somewhat unexpectedly, we gained the upper hand and the dragon
decided to flee, diving into the icy water, but not before issuing a threat that
we would meet again.

We searched the cave for loot and found some real treasures:

Posmet:
- a unidentified weapon (+2)
- Interdimensional Shackles

Thoredim:
- Censer of Controling Air Elementals
- Cloak of Displacement

Kaiya:
- Leather armor of cold resistance
- Boots of speed

Shan:
- a unidentified weapon (+2)
- Drians Fortress

Poor Posmet must be so confused. Finally now we had time to talk to him about what happened...
