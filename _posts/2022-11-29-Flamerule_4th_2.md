# Flamerule 4, the Well of Dragons

We were in the middle of our final battle. Most of the wizards were defeated and
we started to turn our efforts against {% include glossary_link.html title="Tiamat" %} herself.

Tiamat spew her icy breath against {% include glossary_link.html title="Shan" %} an Thoredim, to devastating effect. {% include glossary_link.html title="Shan" %}
took cover, while {% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %} decided to move in, going in close combat with {% include glossary_link.html title="Tiamat" %}
for the first time. Elias meanwhile proved a useful ally and killed another
wizard. At the same time, {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %} summoned one of the Will-o-wisps from his orb
to attack the last two wizards.  Eventually, {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %}, Elias and {% include glossary_link.html title="Shan" %} all join in
the fight against {% include glossary_link.html title="Tiamat" %} herself.

{% include glossary_link.html title="Tiamat" %} was still in the process of gathering her strength, her Black head now
rising. At the same time, she used her mighty voice to frighten {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %} and
{% include glossary_link.html title="Kaiya" %}, followed by an attack with her claws. She managed to knock out {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %},
despite Blackstaff counterspelling her first attempt to do so. {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %} quickly
was revived by {% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %} and {% include glossary_link.html title="Tiamat" %} now found herself flanked by our supporting
forces.

The Arcane Brotherhood now opened a portal to the nine hells and Asmodeus'
devils started pulling Tiamat in. She now downed {% include glossary_link.html title="Shan" %}, who also got immediately
revived by {% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %}. A forceful reminder that her attacks are not to be trifled
with! But now, the green head was the first one to get dragged into the portal.
In general, {% include glossary_link.html title="Tiamat" %} started to look...not so good. It seemed that the tides would
finally change in our favor!

{% include glossary_link.html title="Kaiya" %}, quite unexpectedly, found herself polymorphed into a rat by one of the
wizards. Thoredim revived {% include glossary_link.html title="Shan" %} a second time. Elias hit her with a bite attack.
{% include glossary_link.html title="Tiamat" %} now looked quite horrible, and got dragged back towards the Portal even
more. Now the black head disappeared. We were starting to dare to have some hope
we would make it out of this battle alive!

{% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %} suddenly ran up one of the chains by which {% include glossary_link.html title="Tiamat" %} was dragged back
towards the Portal. When he reached one of the head, he sunk in the Dragon
Slayer with all his might.

{% include glossary_link.html title="Tiamat" %} was dead.

As the limp body fell back towards the portal, {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %} stayed on top, riding the
carcass back into hell. The Portal closed, the sounds of battle had seized - and
both {% include glossary_link.html title="Tiamat" %} and our friend were gone.
