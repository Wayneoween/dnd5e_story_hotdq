# Tarsakh 10th

The teleportation circle brought us from castle Naerytar straight to Icespire
Peak. Instead of a mountain panorama, however, we were greeted by an
underground dungeon. Making our way from room to room, we killed some undead,
cleared out a room full of sarcophagi and finally arrived at the top floor,
where we could confirm through the windows that we were ineed at top of a
mountain. Hearing the shuffling of heavy feed above us, and seen doorways and
stairs worn down by something sizeable and powerful moving through it, a
suspicion began to form. {% include glossary_link.html title="Fynn" %} first recited the "Tale of the fearless five" he
had just finished writing:

### The Tale of the Fearless Five

> &nbsp;
>
> We're the fucking five
>
> Nothing can stand in our way
>
> Even dragons take a dive
>
> Down to an early grave
>
> &nbsp;
>
> Near and far, day and night
>
> We follow down a heroic path
>
> Be villains, be monster or evil wraights
>
> They all sudder in fear in the aftermath
>
> &nbsp;
>
> Cause we're the ferocious five
>
> And we turn wrong to right
>
> Despite the odds we're still alive
>
> So better think twice before you try and take a bite
>

Then turned invisible to explore the top floor of the dungeon, where he
discovered two drakes and a young white dragon. Luckily, he was not discovered
by them in turn.
