### 8th of Tarsakh

On our travels through the {% include glossary_link.html title="Mere of Dead Men" %}, we had some time to review some of
the people and places we encountered on our adventures in the previous weeks:

- **Rezmir:** A black Dragonborn Lady, a higher rank in the {% include glossary_link.html title="Dragon Cult" %}
- **Naerytar:** The castle where the cultists bring their loot. Where we are travelling
- **Purple clothing:** A dragon cultists of higher importance

While resting for the night, {% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %} got woken by a vision. The voice of
Harbin Wester, Mayor of Phandalin came to him in the dark. He said that
Phandalin was endangered by a white dragon (-> Ice Breath, likes the cold) and
implored our group to help. We decided to head north as soon as we solved the
situation at the castle. The dragon encounters do seem to become more. Speaking
of which, the black dragon at the edge of the mere is called {% include glossary_link.html title="Voaraghamanthar" %}.

## 9th of Tarsakh

Finally we arrived at the castle. A large structure, with the huts of both the
lizard and frog people huddled against its south and east sides. The lizardfolk
are NOT happy with the current situation and there were talks about starting a
revolution. There was a discussion in the group whether we should actually
interfer at all - after all the Lizard Folk worship dragons, the Bullywugs
follow the Dragonborn.

We decided that the former actually are the lesser evil as dragons are not
inherently evil, but the Dragonborn seems to be. There were around 40
Bullywugs, 15 Cultists in and around the castle as well as two giant frogs, an
Elf, a Dragonborn (presumably Rezmir) and of course the Lizard People. The
cultists sometimes go to the castle basement but it seems they do not always
return from there.

While the group delivered the crates to the castle, {% include glossary_link.html title="Snapjaw" %} gathered people who
might be helpful to the groups plan. Upon returning to one of the Lizard
Peoples' longhouses, {% include glossary_link.html title="Fynn" %} holds an inspiring speech to them to rally them
behind our cause. We just hadn't quite figured out yet what our cause was at
this point.

Pharblex, leader of the Bullywugs, resides in the Chambers on the second floor
of the castle. Sometimes he is to be found in the dungeon, since it contains
some kind of shrine to the frog peoples god.

For lack of a better plan, {% include glossary_link.html title="Kaiya" %} put on a purple robe, disguised herself as an
old man and walked into the castle, asking the first cultist she saw about the
location of the "secret entrance". Awkwardness ensued, since the entrance was
technically not 'secret' but in the end she left with the information she
needed.

{% include glossary_link.html title="Snapjaw" %} offered to help by stealing some cultist clothing so our group can
sneak into the castle, and the dungeon. We convined a Bullywug to lead us down
into an exceedingly moist and slick dungeon.
