### 3rd of Ches - Longsaddle
We arrived in Longsaddle which was on fire and was attacked by cultists before we arrived. After helping, we met *Fei Long* in the Triboar Tavern called *Fuzzy Quarterstaff*.
We tried to find the Cultist camp in the night but it was too dark.

### 4th of Ches - Searching for the Cultist camp
We found and fought some cultists and met *Gronkh* the Kobold. I gave him one of Venomfangs teeth.

### 6th of Ches - Cultist camp
We did some things, fought some bad guys and killed the *Black Spider*.
