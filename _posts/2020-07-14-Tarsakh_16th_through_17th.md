# Tarsakh 16

After a night in the woods, eating the mushrooms {% include glossary_link.html title="Shan" %} foraged, we made our
way to Neverwinter. {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %} had his mother's sword, but did not wear a mask
anymore. He had exchanged them at his mother's sarcophagus. The sword is a
nasty looking weapon - and is owed a dragon kill!

# Tarsakh 17

We arrived in {% include glossary_link.html title="Neverwinter" %}, {% include glossary_link.html title="Kaiya" %}'s hometown. The city was destroyed by a
volcano eruption and has since been rebuilt. The southeast district is ripped
open by a chasm in the ground that leads to the Underdark, home to many vile
creatures.

{% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %} asked a guard, on whom he discovers a pin of the order of the
gauntlet for some pointers, and we learned the following:

- "Torm's Hail" is a suitable greeting for the {% include glossary_link.html title="Order of the Gauntlet" %} ("I knew this of course!")
- We find more members of the Order in the "Shining Serpent" - North
- For Wizards: "House of Knowledge" in the Protector's Enclave" or "Cloak Tower" to the East
- General shopping: The Docks or "Shining Knights and Armor" at the edge of the graveyard
- Sell gems: "Many coins" money lending
- The "House of thousand faces" is a tavern where you find many shady people, and some of Kayjas guild members
- Plus the rumor that the dragon cultists assemble in the east. This was not the first time we heard about this and it wouldn't be the last.

First stop: The blacksmith! A Minotaur called _Danlion Steelskull_. We sold
various small items, some Elven Chain for 1000 GP. The Dragon Scale Armor
that {% include glossary_link.html title="Shan" %} carried fetched an incredible 10.000 Gold! This meant +1 Studded
Armor for Kaiya and Fynn, and +1 Splint Armor for Posmet and {% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %}. {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %}
seemed to have forgotten his grief for a while while shopping and bargaining
for equipment. A sight to behold!

{% include glossary_link.html title="Kaiya" %} sold the gems she has held onto for 1000 GP, with the help of a little
not-so-subtle intimidation.

At the _House of Thousand Faces_, {% include glossary_link.html title="Kaiya" %} talked to the bartenders and patrons in
Thieves Cant, which sounds like non-consequential small-talk about the
weather to the rest of the group. A readhead halfling woman recognized {% include glossary_link.html title="Kaiya" %}
as "Victor's Girl" and told her to deposit 5 GP at a known location to
receive more infos on the Dragon Cult. Also in the bar, Posmet and {% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %}
worked out that their parents' common deaths must have occured around 20
years ago. {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %} does not know much about his mother's blade, except that he
could summon it at will.

{% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %} then led the group to the Cloak Tower to look for wizards. At the
tower, which initially appeared to have no doors, we got led by an apprentice
to master Sumsquat (Kumquat?). As {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %} handed over his stone, the wizard
embarked on a longer ramble - what we could gather is that it might be an
artefact of "The Great Old Ones", who "infested the stars" (became stars?).
One of them eventually fell, it's name was Hardar. If we want to know more
about it, we need to find a creature named "Aboleth", a creature that houses
in deep waters and underground caverns. {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %} seemed to have - not
consciously - entered into a bargain with the being when he picked up the
sphere. This might be the reason his skin color changed from red to, well,
skin-color. Where he got the stone, there were two more depressions, as if
there had been others. Are there two more people out there that carry a
sphere like this one?

Next, the Shining Serpent Inn, full of guards, paladins and so on. We learned
(once more) that the {% include glossary_link.html title="High Road" %} between {% include glossary_link.html title="Waterdeep" %} and {% include glossary_link.html title="Neverwinter" %} is almost
finished thanks to the great lord Neverember. Must be quite the fellow, this
Lord. We met a level 3 member of the {% include glossary_link.html title="Order of the Gauntlet" %}, "{% include glossary_link.html title="Tysra" %}", a
dwarven woman. {% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %} almost lost his composure, but he didn't! We heard
the same story about the Cultists assembling out east, with the added info
that they have made a deal with Cloud Giants, for one of their flying
castles. Tysra was waiting for news from {% include glossary_link.html title="Ontharr Frume" %} (who sheltered
Shànliáng in Longsaddle and introduced {% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %} to the order), since he is
travelling to {% include glossary_link.html title="Waterdeep" %}.

Should we go there too?
