### 27th of Ches

The F-Five got up early - by their standards - in order to have time for a
hearty breakfast at the Rolling Teabarrel before heading for the caravan.
Everyone was already busy packing up and the group was, in fact, pretty late
to arrive. {% include glossary_link.html title="Fynn" %} catched some gossip about the cult of dragons, people seem
insecure. A week ago, a black dragonborn came through town (not to be
confused with the {% include glossary_link.html title="Black Spider" %} / Nezznar, who was a blue dragonborn). A human
called Ardret, who seemed to be in charge at that point, told the group to
head for the gate, and that is would be around 200 miles to the roadhouse,
quite a trip ahead! The caravan consisted of six supply wagons, 12 guards and
24 laborers. The cultists were among them, of course, some disguised as
guards, others as laborers. The cultists seemed to have recognized {% include glossary_link.html title="Fynn" %},
though - this might be getting ugly earlier than we thought. We took our
faithful oxen-cart with us, to the dismay of Ardret.

### 30th of Ches

After a few days of uneventful travel, we heard a strange growling at night.

### 4th of Tarsakh

The seventh day of our trip. We reached the dreaded "Mere of Dead Men", an
unholy stinking swamp. The weather has dropped since {% include glossary_link.html title="Waterdeep" %} and the road
gradually became a mere trail. So this is the path between Neverwinter and
{% include glossary_link.html title="Waterdeep" %}. The group has tried their best to get Ardret suspicious of the
cultists, but to no avail. He has thus become suspicious to the group himself -
is the cooperating with the cultists after all? The cultists meanwhile had
their eye on us consistently.

### 7th of Tarsakh

The caravan finally arrived at the Roadhouse. The building itself looked like
an unremarkable, run-down two-story roadhouse. A half-orc was busy directing
people, making sure that certian supplies went into the strongroom. In the
process of unloading, we noticed that this half-orc, called Bogluck, carried
a dragon cultists scabbard. {% include glossary_link.html title="Fynn" %} meanwhile got invisbile and snuck into the
strongroom. Of the many boxes there, some were marked with an X. {% include glossary_link.html title="Fynn" %} opened
one and found it full of gemstones and gold! After taking a little as proof,
he headed back to tell the group of his discovery. The group, together with
Jemna Gleamsilver in her room, decided to observe where the treasure is moved
to. A risk in this plan is, that the strongroom may have a trap door that
{% include glossary_link.html title="Fynn" %} hasn't seen, so maybe the treasure could be moved without being noticed.
{% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %} then used his magic to suggest to Bogluck to hand his keys to the
strongroom to {% include glossary_link.html title="Kaiya" %} and head straight to bed...
