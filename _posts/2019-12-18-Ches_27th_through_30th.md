### 27th of Ches

The F-Five got up early - by their standards - in order to have time for a
hearty breakfast at the Rolling Teabarrel before heading for the caravan.
Everyone was already busy packing up and the group was, in fact, pretty late
to arrive. {% include glossary_link.html title="Fynn" %} catched some gossip about the cult of dragons, people seem
insecure. A week ago, a black dragonborn came through town (not to be
confused with the {% include glossary_link.html title="Black Spider" %} / Nezznar, who was a blue dragonborn). A human
called Ardret, who seemed to be in charge at that point, told the group to
head for the gate, and that is would be around 200 miles to the roadhouse,
quite a trip ahead! The caravan consisted of six supply wagons, 12 guards and
24 laborers. The cultists were among them, of course, some disguised as
guards, others as laborers. The cultists seemed to have recognized {% include glossary_link.html title="Fynn" %},
though - this might be getting ugly earlier than we thought. We took our
faithful oxen-cart with us, to the dismay of Ardret.
