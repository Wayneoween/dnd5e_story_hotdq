# Greengrass

Greengrass - what a perfect day to slay a dragon!

The group snuck down to the dragon's lair, laying out a detailed plan to cover
all the exit and attacking it from multiple angles. And there it was, resting
on a platform on the eastern side of the cave, while it's huge pile of treasure
was a little ways off on the eastern side.

Eventually, we attacked! The dragon fought bravely, but was no match for our
united strength, aided by Blagothkus and the other giants. Suddenly, Abras Jos
and his companion appeared and immediately attacked us - at least now we knew
where his allegiance lied. We disposed of them and, eventually, {% include glossary_link.html title="Kaiya" %} put a
bolt through the dragon's eye and we watched it tumble to the ground, dead.

I have to admit, we were in a sort of frenzy afterwards, looting the dragon,
going through it's pile of treasures. We found... a whole lot!

In our excitement, no one seemed to have noticed that {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %} was no longer
among us...
