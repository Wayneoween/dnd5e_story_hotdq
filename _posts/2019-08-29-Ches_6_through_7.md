### 6th of Ches - Cultist camp

We did some things, fought some bad guys and killed the *Black Spider*!

Destroyed two dragon eggs. It felt very bad. We, or at least *Shan* and I felt
that way because we didnâ€™t want to kill the Guard Drakes, but there was no
other way.

The greater good is to stop the revival of the five headed chromatic dragon
*Tiamat*.

And apparently _we_ need to stop that from happening. We decided not to
take another closer look after that Roper.

### 7th of Ches - Travel

We make our way to Longsaddle.
