# Greengrass

As we were looting the cave of the dragon we just have killed, we noticed
that the noise upstairs has suddenly ceased. Rushing upstairs, our path was
blocked by a black sphere, like the one {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %} can conjure. After a couple of
minutes, the sphere disappeared and we could continue our path.

Upstairs, we discovered the aftermath of what looks to be a battle between
both factions of the cultists, with the vampires seemingly getting involved
as well. Dead cultists, ogres, kobolds were lying everywhere, some corpses
undeniably had {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %}’s handwriting, others had their neck torn into.

The vampire tower itself was abandoned, with the windows wide open.
Apparently the vampires had decided to look for a new place to stay.

We searched the whole castle for a trace of Posmet, without success. {% include glossary_link.html title="Kaiya" %}
checked out Abra’s quarter, where she found a correspondence with Severin. It
confirmed what we already knew: The wizards of the Fey that help the dragon
cult are a splinter group that wants to overthrow their current ruler. For
some reason, Severin thinks that these wizards are very important to raise
{% include glossary_link.html title="Tiamat" %}. Enough reason for us to have an eye on them, should one of them
appear near the cultists again.

The second wizard we defeated by Abras side was confirmed to be a Simulacrum,
a duplicate of himself. It turned into sand when we killed it – did Rezmir
also just send a Simulacrum?.

{% include glossary_link.html title="Kaiya" %} finally managed to open the chest, finding 20 pearls and 200 GPs. She
also discovered a Scroll of sending in her bag of holding - with a note from
{% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %}: “If I don’t survive this fight, here is my stuff”.

The group kept puzzling over {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %}’s fate over the next four days while the
castle made its way to {% include glossary_link.html title="Waterdeep" %}. With the scroll, we could send a message
ahead to announce our arrival and avoid unnecessary panic. At our landing,
the group was greeted by a delegation of various members of the order of the
gauntlet, along with Fei Long, Shanliang and Onthar Frume.

{% include glossary_link.html title="Ontharr Frume" %}, after some praise, told us that there would be a council
meeting the next day: Many factions in Faerun would be coming together,
uniting against the order of the dragon. How exciting for us!

As we said our farewells to Blagothkus, he promised to try to unite the
giants into an alliance against the cult as well. May we see him at the final
battle at the well of the dragons!

Since we have some time to kill until the council meeting would start the
next day, we decide to run some errands in the city. First stop: Chalos
Wondrous Vault. Especially {% include glossary_link.html title="Kaiya" %} used the chance to identify various items
she was carrying around for quite a while now. {% include glossary_link.html title="Fynn" %} asked Chalos about
{% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %}’s sphere that he had taken in his possession now, unfortunately with
no success.

{% include glossary_link.html title="Waterdeep" %} was wide open! Where would we go next?
