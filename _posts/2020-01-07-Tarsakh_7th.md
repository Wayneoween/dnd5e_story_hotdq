### 7th of Tarsakh (cont.)

We still are in the Roadhouse. The group had a looong discussion of possible
plans. {% include glossary_link.html title="Kaiya" %} went out to observe the vicinity, making sure no one escapes the
building. She found a shrub to hide behind, stayed there and froze. {% include glossary_link.html title="Fynn" %} and
{% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %} meanwhile stood guard while {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %} investigated the strongroom. He
found a box that, when opened, turned out to be a secret entrance.

Behind it, {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %} discovered a
familiar faces: Six Lizardfolk that he met years ago. They stated they
were here to "pick up the shipments", a task which {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %}
eagerly offered to help to. For good measure, he hummed the "I
like dragons" tune which the Lizardfolk immediately recognized. They then told
him that the tunnel leads to a castle some distance away. The F* Five
assembled, grabbed some boxes and headed straight into the tunnel, mostly
wondering who this guy is that {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %}
has met?

The group emerged in the middle of a swamp, surrounded by seven lizard people,
one of which is {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %}'s old friend, {% include glossary_link.html title="Snapjaw" %}. Introductions ensued, during
which we learned how {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %} and {% include glossary_link.html title="Snapjaw" %} know each other: At some point the
Lizardfolks' swamp has dried out, suddenly a friendly Hobgoblin showed up,
wanting to learn more. He studied Draconic and at some point moved on. The
Lizardfolk moved to this swamp, met a black Dragonborn lady, who is looking for
a black dragon living in a cave at the edge of the mere. The Dragonlady hired
them first, but then switched to the Bullywags (Frog People). Their
(Frogpeople) leader is: Pharblex Spattergoo. Not all lizard people work for the
cultists. Those who do, got worthless pendants as payment from the dragon lady,
which they seem to like a great deal.

{% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %} suggested them to leave the swamp to avoid getting in the line of fire
when we are hunting dragons, but they were not convinced. First we went on our
way to go with them to the castle. The oxen and the cart stayed at the Roadhouse, I wonder if we'll forget about it?
{% include glossary_link.html title="Fynn" %} tried to convince {% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %} that the swamp tastes like ale.

Suddenly, three Lizardfolk got stuck in quicksand. {% include glossary_link.html title="Shan" %} pulled them out, but
the group lost two crates. After a surprisingly uneventful night, the group
arrives at a shore with five canoes, trying to decide how to split up the group
into those boats...
