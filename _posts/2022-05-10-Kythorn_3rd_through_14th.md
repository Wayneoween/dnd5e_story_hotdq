# Kythorn 3rd through 11th

To reach our next destination, the Misty Forest where we assumed the green mask
would be, we had around eight days of travel ahead. The trip went by
uneventfully, although unpleasant, with heavy rainfalls and through swampy
terrain. On the last day, we saw smoke rising up in the distance, accompanied by
screams. Eventually, we saw a green dragon flying away.

Getting closer, we found a burning encampment, tree houses on fire, elves
wounded, dead or trying to put out fires everywhere! While {% include glossary_link.html title="Shan" %} and {% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %}
delivered healing, {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %} found his way to the leader, prince Alagarthas. We
learned that this was not only a dragon attack, but dragon cultists immediately
followed to kill and loot. It also wasn't the first attack of this kind. In the
evening, the elves invited us up to the tree houses for shelter. Here we heard
them tell stories that the dragon was ridden by a human in purple robes. The
prince dismisses this as rumor, but the things we have seen cultists do, I
wouldn't put it past them. Maybe the dragon mask enables one to do this?

We piece together that our liberation of Skyreach Castle drove the cultists
here, to search for new sources of loot. Not a good feeling to be indirectly
responsible for what happened here.

The prince agreed to first bring us to his father, the king of this realm, and
then point us to where we can find the dragon. Turned out the prince's brother
is actually Neronvain, the cultist leader who is the wearer of the green mask!
Alagarthas is unhappy to hear that his brother, whose whereabouts he didn't
know, had turned to this path. But ultimately he said, his father has to decide
how to proceed.

# Kythorn 12th through 14th

The next day, we went on our way through the forest. After a while, we
encountered spider webs growing thicker and thicker - until we were suddenly
attacked by creatures of this forest: Giant spiders and other monsters (?). As
we rest that night, {% include glossary_link.html title="Shan" %} tries out another one of his beans, creating a campfire
with blue flames. The next morning, we see the trees moving, one sitting right
outside of our instant fortress and complimenting {% include glossary_link.html title="Shan" %} on his fire. This forest
is full of surprises.

Next stop: Alagarthas father!
