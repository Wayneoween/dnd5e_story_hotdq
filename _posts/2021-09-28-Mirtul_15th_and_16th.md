# Mirtul 15th

Here we were, just won the battle with the Trolls when we suddenly heard
WanRenMi's voice. As we followed it to another room, we found in it the oddest
of structures: a shelter made of carpets and whale ribs. Inside, there were
things, furniture, books and much more from all over Faerun!

Inside the shelter, there was WanRenMi, chained to the floor with magical
shackles and guarded by two white kobolds. {% include glossary_link.html title="Shan" %}, in his admiration for the bird,
could not believe that he was actually captured, so he kept pressing him for
what his plan was and why he let himself get caught.

The goblins, though guarding WanRenMi, seemed mostly calm and compliant.
Unfortunately, they did not have the key to the chains and we were reluctant to
destroy them, since they were magical and probably on the dragon's radar. We
decided to rest and take the time to come up with a plan. In the meantime, {% include glossary_link.html title="Kaiya" %}
fed some of the villager's fish to the Kobolds, upon which one of them fell
asleep. The other one became a bit suspicious, so we saw no other way but to
grab him and tie him up.

WanRenMi shared with us that he last saw the Old White Death 2 to 3 days ago,
and it was indeed a VERY old dragon. Moreover, the Draakhorn seemed to be gone,
freely given by the dragon to Severin of the Dragon Cultists. It probably will
play a role in the ritual to raise {% include glossary_link.html title="Tiamat" %}.  There were some good news, however:
Somewhere in this cave was some ball that could be used to destroy dragon masks.
Immediately our minds started racing, how we could use this without the dragon
being alerted.

Eventually, {% include glossary_link.html title="Kaiya" %} came up with an idea how to free WanRenMi without destroying
the chains: She gave her cloak to him, so he could polymorph into a bat, and
slip out of the foot cuffs.  While he attuned to the cloak, we searched this and
the next room and found a lot of scrolls, apparently left behind by the last
person living here who seemed to be a Wizard. {% include glossary_link.html title="Kaiya" %} took into her bag of holding
7 scrolls:

- Freedom of movement
- Spare the dying
- Tongues
- Firebolt
- Gaseous Form
- Waterbreathing
- Ewards black tentacles (Warlock)

{% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %} kept those 3 that can be used by a Paladin:

- Shield of Faith
- Haste
- Protection from Energy

# Mirtul 16th

After our rest, we explored the rest of the cave. We found a room full of
treasures that we decided to save for last, a set of stairs leading up (possibly
back to the village) and... a room full of the mangled frozen corpses of Frost
Giants. A terrifying collection by the dragon! The room also contained eight
Kobolds that were busy polishing the icy displays when, upon noticing us, they
tried to escape. Not knowing what else to do, we killed all eight of them in a
regrettable act of violence. {% include glossary_link.html title="Shan" %} especially really tried to spare the two he
took care of, to no avail. Kobolds are REALLY easy to kill.

Finally, we tackled the treasure room. We did our best to be quiet, since we had
already heard some movement from deep below. {% include glossary_link.html title="Shan" %} cast Detect Magic and started
going through all magic items in the room. Before long, he found the ball we
were looking for, hidden inside the mast of a ship that was somehow placed in
here. The ball oddly reminded us of {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %}'s orb, just instead of a desert, this
one had snowstorms swirling on its surface.

{% include glossary_link.html title="Shan" %} touched the black dragon mask with the orb, trying to find out if this
would destroy the mask. Two things happened at once: Below our feet, the dragon
started stirring, he obviously noticed something happening. And second, black
tendrils appeared out of nowhere - and suddenly {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %} was standing next to us!

How would we get out of this situation alive..?

Open Quests:

- Rescue WanRenMi
- Get Draakhorn
- Find Zhentarim to acquire the white dragon mask. Go to “Earls Tavern” in {% include glossary_link.html title="Waterdeep" %} to find them.
- Talk to Remalia Haventree when we’re back in {% include glossary_link.html title="Waterdeep" %}
- Blackstaff, Archmage of Waterdeep, kept {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %}’s orb to find out more about it in Candlekeep. If she discovers useful information, we owe her a favor. She discovered that the Orb belonged to Asmodeus. We should meet up again.
