# Mirtul 16th

The dragon was gone and we finally had a moment to catch our breath... and ask
{% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %} what the hell has happened! We told us that he was indeed inside the Orb
and while his memories were a bit odd, he seemed to have been summoned by his
patron. We learned that there are five orbs, just like {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %}'s. He now has the
red and white ones, and somewhere is a black, blue and yellow one each. Those
correspond to the colors of the dragon masks and we have the theory that
touching a mask with the corresponding orb will destroy it. Or do *something*
with it at least.

We decided to get to safety first before talking any further. As we discussed
where to go from here, {% include glossary_link.html title="Shan" %} remembered that there is a teleportation circle in
Oyaviggaton. Searching a bit, we discovered it under some ice in an otherwise
empty room. Before we took our leave, Lenka told us that the villagers seemed
quite happy that the dragon was gone. We went topside, Shan and {% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %} loudly
boasting about our fight with the dragon. Upon hearing this, the villagers
immediately pack their things and get ready to leave. It seems like they have
not exactly been on this iceberg voluntarily. We advise Lenka to change the
appearance of her ship and eventually everyone parts quickly, getting away as
far as possible, before the dragon would return.

We teleported to castle Naeritar, where we were happily welcomed by {% include glossary_link.html title="Snapjaw" %} and
his Lizardfolk. In the evening, we huddle around the fire, trading stories and
questions. {% include glossary_link.html title="Kaiya" %} would like to see {% include glossary_link.html title="Shan" %}'s Instant Fortress, upon which they try
to find a space to safely activate it. We also asked {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %} a little more about
his patron, which he calls his "Employer". Apparently he has never seen him
directly, but he follows him unconditionally because that is what he always has
done. He also does not know exactly who he is or where he is from. What he knows
is that the Employer is fiendish, from another dimension and also seems to want
{% include glossary_link.html title="Tiamat" %} to stay banished where she is now.  What is more, since his return,
{% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %} has Giant runes on his armor and weapon, (Cloud and Frost), which seem to
bestow upon him magical abilities to better fight dragons.

After a loooong time, we rediscovered our cart and oxen (Olaf) and decided to
take them with us on our nine-day journey along the {% include glossary_link.html title="High Road" %} to {% include glossary_link.html title="Waterdeep" %}.  On
the third day, we found the overturned statue of a dwarven figure. {% include glossary_link.html title="Thoredim" %},
despite his Stonecunning, had a hard time making sense of the motif, and {% include glossary_link.html title="Posmet" %}
only partially succeeded in re-erecting it. {% include glossary_link.html title="Kaiya" %} finally found an inscription:
"Nemdam Hillfinger". Eventually, we decided to leave without achieving anything.

We finally arrived in {% include glossary_link.html title="Waterdeep" %} with a long list of errands to run and
businesses to attend to. Looks like we would be here for quite a while...
