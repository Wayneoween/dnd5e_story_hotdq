A bustling mercantile town that stands where the {% include glossary_link.html title="Long Road" %} meets the Evermoor
Way. {% include glossary_link.html title="Triboar" %}’s name is thought to have come from a traveler’s tale of slaying
three boars here in the same day, over four hundred winters ago.
