Many paladins and clerics of Tyr, Helm, Torm, and Hoar have joined the
organization, seeing it as—finally!—a way of making common cause against the
evils abroad in the world. The Order of the Gauntlet is ready to lash out the
moment evil acts, and not a moment before. When evil breaks laws, agreements,
or commonly accepted codes of conduct, the Gauntlet strikes hard and fast,
without waiting for the blessings of distant temples or the permission of
rulers. Evil must be met in the field and smashed, or it will swiftly overcome
all.

#### Beliefs

- Faith is the greatest weapon against evil—faith in one’s god, one’s friends, and one’s self.
- Battling evil is an extraordinary task that requires extraordinary strength and bravery.
- Punishing an evil act is just. Punishing an evil thought is not.

#### Goals

To be armed, vigilant, and ready to smite evil, enforce justice, and enact
retribution. This means identifying evil threats such as secretive power
groups and inherently evil creatures, watching over them, and being ready to
attack the moment they misbehave. (These are always retributive strikes, never
preemptive.)
