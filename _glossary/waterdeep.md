Rising from the shores of its deep harbor to ring the great mountain standing
tall out of the Sea of Swords is Waterdeep, the City of Splendors and the Crown
of the North. To all of *Faer√ªn*, this great metropolis stands as the pinnacle of
what a great city might be, in wealth, influence, and stability.
