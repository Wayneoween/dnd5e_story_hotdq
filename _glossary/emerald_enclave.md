The Emerald Enclave is a far-ranging group that opposes threats to the natural
world and helps others survive the many perils of the wild. A ranger might be
hired to lead a caravan through a treacherous mountain pass or the frozen
tundra of Icewind Dale. A druid might volunteer to help a small village
prepare for a long, brutal winter. Barbarians and witches who live like
hermits most of the year might defend a town against marauding orcs or
barbarians. Members of the Emerald Enclave know how to survive, and more
importantly, they want to help others do the same. They are not opposed to
civilization or progress, but they strive to prevent civilization and the
wilderness from destroying one another.

#### Beliefs

- The natural order must be respected and preserved.
- Forces that seek to upset the natural balance must be destroyed.
- The wilderness can be harsh. Not everyone can survive in it without assistance.

#### Goals

To restore and preserve the natural order, keep the elemental forces of the
world in check, keep civilization and the wilderness from destroying one
another, and help others survive the perils of the wilderness.
