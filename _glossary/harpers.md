The {% include glossary_link.html title="Harpers" %} is an old organization that has risen, been shattered, and risen
again several times. Its longevity and resilience are largely due to its
decentralized, grassroots, secretive nature, and the near-autonomy of many of
its members. The {% include glossary_link.html title="Harpers" %} have “cells” and lone operatives throughout Faerûn,
although they interact and share information with one another from time to
time as needs warrant. The {% include glossary_link.html title="Harpers" %}' ideology is noble, and its members pride
themselves on their integrity and incorruptibility. {% include glossary_link.html title="Harpers" %} do not seek power
or glory, only fair and equal treatment for all.

#### Beliefs

- One can never have too much information.
- Too much power leads to corruption.
- No one should be powerless..

#### Goals

To gather information throughout Faerûn, discern the political dynamics within
each region or realm, and promote fairness and equality by covert means. Act
openly as a last resort. Thwart tyrants and any leader, government, or group
that grows too powerful, and aid the weak, the poor, and the oppressed.
