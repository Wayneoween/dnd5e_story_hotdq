The Harpers is an old organization that has risen, been shattered, and risen
again several times. Its longevity and resilience are largely due to its
decentralized, grassroots, secretive nature, and the near-autonomy of many of
its members. The Harpers have “cells” and lone operatives throughout Faerûn,
although they interact and share information with one another from time to
time as needs warrant. The Harpers' ideology is noble, and its members pride
themselves on their integrity and incorruptibility. Harpers do not seek power
or glory, only fair and equal treatment for all.

#### Beliefs

- One can never have too much information.
- Too much power leads to corruption.
- No one should be powerless..

#### Goals

To gather information throughout Faerûn, discern the political dynamics within
each region or realm, and promote fairness and equality by covert means. Act
openly as a last resort. Thwart tyrants and any leader, government, or group
that grows too powerful, and aid the weak, the poor, and the oppressed.
