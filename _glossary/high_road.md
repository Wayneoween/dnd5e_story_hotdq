This well-traveled highway follows the coast from Luskan to {% include glossary_link.html title="Waterdeep" %},
connecting with Neverwinter along the way. For years, the stretch of the High
Road between Neverwinter and {% include glossary_link.html title="Waterdeep" %} fell into disuse and disrepair because
of frequent monster attacks. When he was both the Lord Protector of Neverwinter
and the Open Lord of {% include glossary_link.html title="Waterdeep" %}, Lord Dagult Neverember hired adventurers to
make the old road safe and spent considerable coin to repair it. Many now
consider the {% include glossary_link.html title="High Road" %} a safer means of travel than a sea voyage.
