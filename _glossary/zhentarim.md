The Zhentarim seeks to become omnipresent and inescapable, more wealthy and
powerful, and most importantly, untouchable. The public face of the
organization appears much more benign, offering the best mercenaries money can
buy. When a merchant needs an escort for his caravan, when a noble needs
bodyguards to protect her holdings, or when a city needs trained soldiers to
defend its honor, the Zhentarim provides the best-trained fighting men and
women money can buy. However, the cost of doing business with the Black
Network can be high.

#### Beliefs

- The Zhentarim is your family. You watch out for it, and it watches out for you.
- You are the master of your own destiny. Never be less than what you deserve to be.
- Everything—and everyone—has a price.

#### Goals

To amass wealth, power, and influence.
