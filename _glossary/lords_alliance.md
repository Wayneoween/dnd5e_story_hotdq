The Lords’ Alliance is a coalition of rulers from cities and towns across
Faerûn (primarily in the North), who collectively agree that some solidarity
is needed to keep evil at bay. The rulers of Waterdeep, Silverymoon,
Neverwinter, and other free cities in the region dominate the Alliance, and
every lord in the Alliance works for the fate and fortune of his or her own
settlement above all others. The agents of the Alliance include sophisticated
bards, zealous paladins, talented mages, and grizzled warriors. They are
chosen primarily for their loyalty, and are trained in observation, stealth,
innuendo, and combat. Backed by the wealthy and the privileged, they carry
quality equipment (often disguised to appear common), and spellcasters tend to
have a large number of scrolls with communication spells.

#### Beliefs

- If civilization is to survive, all must unite against the dark forces that threaten it.
- Glory comes from protecting one’s home and honoring its leaders.
- The best defense is a strong offense.

#### Goals

To ensure the safety and prosperity of the cities and other settlements of
Faerûn by forming a strong coalition against the forces that threaten all,
eliminate such threats by any means necessary whenever and wherever they
arise, and be champions of the people.
